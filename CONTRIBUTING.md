Nice to see you want to contribute to this project! :+1: :tada:
Please have a look at this guide to know what you are changing.

As I do not want to duplicate the instructions all over, please **find the common contributors docs here**: https://github.com/TinyWebEx/common/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

Some links and potential special rules for this repo only are listed below.

## Support us!

You like this add-on, but have no idea how to support us?

Here are some easy things you can always do:

* Spread the word and recommend it to others! 🤗😍
* Leave a rating [at addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/offline-qr-code/reviews/) if you like it!
  Also consider writing some text and not only leaving stars there. It's always nice to hear some warm words. ☺️
* Star this project [on GitHub](https://github.com/rugk/offline-qr-code) by clicking the "star" icon!
* Leave a [review at alternativeto.net](https://alternativeto.net/software/offline-qr-code-generator/reviews/) and click the like button there, if you want. (Also, you can obviously recommend this add-on as an alternative to other emoji pickers.)

## Translations

It would be great if you can contribute your translations! You can either translate the JSON files directly or use [this online translator service](https://lusito.github.io/web-ext-translator/?gh=https://github.com/rugk/offline-qr-code).

**Manually:** To translate it manually, go to [`src/_locales/en`](src/_locales/en) and copy the English (or any other existing language) `messages.json` file. (You could also use another source language if you want, but usually English is the best.) Create a new dir at `src/_locales` with the abbreviation of the language you want to translate.  
**Web-ext-translator:** Go to [this page](https://lusito.github.io/web-ext-translator/) and translate it online. Download the result by clicking on "Export to ZIP" at the bottom.

At the end, just submit a Pull Request with your changed files.
Of course, you can (and should) improve existing translations.

For more details, [see the official docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Internationalization#Providing_localized_strings_in__locales).

### Other items to translate

* Text assets to translate: [`assets/texts`](assets/texts)
* Screenshots: [`assets/screenshots`](assets/screenshots)
* Wiki to translate: [wiki](../../wiki)
* Sidebar file for adding language: [`_Sidebar` file](../../wiki/_Sidebar/_edit)

For more information, see the whole [contributing doc](https://github.com/TinyWebEx/common/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#translations).

## Coding

See the **common guide** on how to [start coding](https://github.com/TinyWebEx/common/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#coding) and what rules to follow.

### Tests

* Test dir: [`src/tests/`](src/tests/)
* EsLint config for tests: [`src/tests/.eslintrc`](src/tests/.eslintrc)

## Need ideas?

Don't have any idea what to take up? [Here you can find a list of good issues for starters](../../contribute), e.g. if you want to start with this project or a (programming) language in general.
However, of course, feel free to take on any issue (that is not claimed or assigned to someone else).

Also, there are other add-on's, which are very similar and may also need work:

* [Awesome Emoji Picker](https://github.com/rugk/how-did-i-get-here/contribute)
* [Mastodon Simplified Federation](https://github.com/rugk/mastodon-simplified-federation/contribute)
* [How did I get here?](https://github.com/rugk/how-did-i-get-here/contribute)
* [Dark Mode Website Switcher](https://github.com/rugk/website-dark-mode-switcher/contribute)

There is also [an overview over all good first issues in other add-on repos](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+user%3Arugk+user%3ATinyWebEx+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
