In contrast to many other add-ons, which use Google Web APIs for generating QR codes, this add-on works completely offline. <b>This QR code generator puts your privacy first!</b>
It does this by working <em>offline</em>, independently of any internet connection! Always.


<b>So easy, you can use it with one click!</b>

It has a radically <b>simple, yet powerful</b> user interface, allowing you to tweak many details in the settings. Nevertheless, it's really easy to use! For instance, you can <b>just resize the QR code</b> with your mouse by dragging and dropping. Being <b>lightweight</b> and thus having a small size it is also fast and easy to install – even on mobile connections.

It is inspired by <a href="https://github.com/catholicon/OfflineQR">the old Offline QR code generator add-on</a> for Firefox 56 and lower.


<b>Generate a variety of QR codes!</b>
Generate <b>colored</b> QR codes, <b>save</b> QR codes or simply just use them to send a tab or other text from your desktop to your mobile! You have the choice!
Your QR code will only be <b>one click away</b> and you can instantly start typing to change the QR code text!
